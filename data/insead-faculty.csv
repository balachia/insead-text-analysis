Her links to alumni in the venture space were instrumental in the 2015 formation of “INSEAD Alum Ventures (IAV)”, the school’s first dedicated seed fund, by Alumni – for Alumni.

Professor Zeisberger is known for her extensive research on PE in emerging markets, and her output is a function of her close working relationships with private equity firms and their investee companies, institutional investors, Family Offices and Sovereign Wealth Funds.

Joining Academia in 2005 after a 16-year career in investment banking & alternative investments, allowed her to leverage her extensive network and combine her passion for education & innovation by connecting academia with industry. 

In 2010, she launched INSEAD’s popular elective “Managing Corporate Turnarounds,” which combines in-class case studies and visits from industry professionals with an intensive computer-based simulation involving the iconic car brand SAAB and its struggle with bankruptcy. Over a full weekend student teams work to rescue the distressed car manufacturer by drawing on their management, finance and operational skills while facing increasingly complex decisions impacting both the firm’s short-term liquidity and long-term value creation. Students consider MCT the perfect course to put their MBA skills to test; corporations see the simulation as an opportunity to prepare their senior executives for challenging times ahead.

Professor Zeisberger teaches the Private Equity & Venture Capital, Corporate Turnaround and Risk management electives in INSEAD’s MBA, EMBA and Executive Education programmes. She has frequently been nominated for the “Best Teaching Award” in her PE elective and has been awarded the “Dean’s Commendation for Excellence in MBA Teaching” annually since 2008.

He was a licensed Certified Public Accountant (CPA) in Pennsylvania, working for Price Waterhouse and then Westinghouse prior to attending graduate school.

His research focuses on the determinants and effects of discretionary disclosure in financial reports. That is, why do some firms just disclose the minimum of information as required by securities laws while others voluntarily exceed that benchmark considerably? Further, are there tangible financial effects from these decisions? He also examines real economic effects that firms may experience when they make seemingly cosmetic accounting choices. For example, he has studied how firms alter their share repurchase strategies to improve earnings per share (EPS) performance, while at the same time cutting long-term investments to finance the strategy.

Daniel has taught in full-time and Executive MBA programmes, as well as non-degree executive education. He received the INSEAD Dean’s Commendation for Excellence in MBA Teaching in 2013-2015 and has been twice nominated by INSEAD MBA students as Best Core Course Professor.

Organisational Behaviour","Elizabeth Baily Wolf is an Assistant Professor of Organisational Behaviour at INSEAD.

Professor Wolf’s research focuses on how people subjectively evaluate their own and others’ performance, competence, and potential (i.e., form self-assessments and metaperceptions). She is particularly interested in how emotion, nonverbal behavior, gender, and national culture influence these processes. 

Subjective evaluations play a crucial role in organisational life. Individual’s evaluations of themselves shape their aspirations, persistence, and decision-making; and individual’s evaluations of others decide outcomes such as hiring, role assignments, job security, and promotions. Because subjective evaluations have important downstream effects, inaccurate evaluations lead to a variety of costly consequences for organisations. For example, performers may fail to develop valuable skills, top performers may opt out of organisations, or evaluators may misassign tasks or roles among performers.

The goal of Professor Wolf’s work is to make organisations more effective by helping individuals evaluate themselves and others more accurately. Two important barriers to accurate evaluation and self-assessment are 1) miscommunications about emotion and 2) stereotyping and prejudice. Her research seeks to understand how to minimise the undermining effects of these two barriers. 

Her research has been published in leading academic journals, such as Organizational Behavior and Human Decision Processes, Journal of Personality and Social Psychology, and Journal of Experimental Social Psychology, and was featured in various media, including Bloomberg, Forbes, and NPR.

Before coming to INSEAD, Professor Wolf completed her PhD in Organisational Behavior at Harvard Business School. Her dissertation examined how evaluators’ emotional expressions convey performance feedback to those whom they evaluate. She received her BA summa cum laude from the Connecticut College where she double-majored in Psychology and Hispanic Studies and received her CISLA certificate in International Studies. Born to a British father and an American mother, Professor Wolf grew up in the United States. She has spent time living in Spain and Germany.

For the past 20 years, Ioana has been researching a wide range of avenues for making decisions, based on theoretical models, data, emotions and, more recently, the body. In her work, she likes challenging assumptions and connecting fields. Owing to her math background, her research started off anchored in classical quantitative models of optimization and uncertainty. She then applied these models to develop practical pricing decision-support algorithms for organisations. Ioana brought the human element into this research field by incorporating emotions and biases into analytical decision models. With a purpose to serve the economically underprivileged, she developed structural models and field experiments to improve access to energy in Africa. Finally, because this work hasn’t actually helped her make better decisions, she is currently exploring embodied approaches to decision making.

Ioana is passionate about education. She teaches a variety of courses on decision making, to MBAs, executives and PhDs. She developed new courses, including the first business course on pricing analytics, and recently an experiential course on embodied decisions. 

Ioana has received numerous accolades for her research and teaching, including the Best Teacher Award for MBA core courses and the Dean’s Commendation for Teaching Excellence. Her research was featured in leading academic journals, including Management Science, Operations Research, Manufacturing & Service Operations Management, Mathematics of Operations Research, and honoured with several research excellence awards, including the M&SOM Best Paper Award, the INFORMS Decision Analysis Best Student Paper Award, the INFORMS Junior Faculty Best Paper Award and a Nicholson prize finalist. In service to the academic community, Ioana has mentored several PhD students, held Associate Editor positions at the major journals and served on the academic board of ESMT. 

Originally from Romania, Ioana has lived on four continents, and was honoured as a YGL (2009) by the World Economic Forum. She is an artist at heart and finds it difficult to write academic bios.

Organisational Behaviour","Li Huang is an Assistant Professor of Organisational Behaviour at INSEAD. She holds a PhD in Management and Organisations from the Kellogg School of Management, Northwestern University.

Professor Huang's research examines the individual and organizational effects of psychological contradictions. Psychological contradictions are misalignments between individuals’ “true” feelings or desires and what they are socially or psychologically compelled to experience. These contradictions often manifest in different types of incongruence between individuals’ thoughts, feelings, and behaviors. Professor Huang’s research suggests that psychological contradictions, though aversive, possess epistemic and motivational values and that their presence and resolution can be adaptive to organisations and societies. Her interest in this topic has led her to two fundamental questions facing modern organizations: (1) how do psychological contradictions affect workplace performance and relationship? (2) how can we resolve these contradictions in a way that fulfills organizations’ and their members’ needs for interdependence or independence? 

Professor Huang has published in leading academic journals such as Academy of Management Journal, Organizational Behavior and Human Decision Processes, Psychological Science, Personality and Social Psychology Bulletin, Journal of Experimental Social Psychology, Social Psychological and Personality Science, and Behavioral and Brain Sciences. Her research has been recognised by the scientific community through awards, fellowships, and grants from the American Psychological Association, the Society of Experimental Social Psychology, and the Dispute Resolution Research Center. Her research and insights have also received numerous media mentions including The Wall Street Journal, New York Times, National Public Radio (NPR), The Economist, Financial Times, ABC News, The Boston Globe, The Huffington Post, MIT Sloan Management Review, Scientific American, Smithsonian.com, The Globe and Mail (Canada), The Independent (UK), The Times (UK). 

Professor Huang teaches the Negotiations course in the MBA and the Executive Education programmes, The Value of Trust course in the MBA programme, as well as the Organisational Behaviour course in the PhD programme. Her teaching has received Dean’s Commendation for Excellence in MBA Teaching at INSEAD. 

Prior to joining the INSEAD faculty, she taught in the MBA program at the Kellogg School of Management, Northwestern University. A native of China, she has lived and worked for several years in the United States.

Trained as a clinical psychologist, she also works with both individuals and families at a centre, which she co-founded in Paris. 

She received her Doctorate in Clinical Psychology and Psychoanalysis from the Université of Paris. Her undergraduate degree is from Cornell University, her master's degree is from Northeastern University, and she completed a postgraduate program in clinical psychology at Hebrew University in Israel.

Identity development, diversity, and change have been an interest in her research, consulting and teaching over the years. Her initial research focused on managing workforce diversity and the development of people’s lives and careers. Dr Brimm's research and consulting interests currently focus on Global Cosmopolitans. Her groundbreaking book, Global Cosmopolitans, The Creative Edge of Difference, published in September 2010, combines her study of identity development and change in the lives of the next generation of global leaders and the use of narrative writing and analysis. Her work has been described as presenting 'a whole new concept of careers, and thereby, becomes one of the most important career development books published in the last decade'.

While her earlier work focused on competence and challenges affecting identity for people in relatively early career and life stages, her current research focuses on people that are in a different life stage and have experienced significant success in their professional lives. Her current research examines the lives of Global Cosmopolitan senior executives and entrepreneurs. Using a narrative approach she is pulling together, through their stories and analysis, the impact of different life stages on the lives of Global Cosmopolitans and the impact of growing up in a different generation and in a different global context. This work should also afford an understanding of the ways people find to manage what appear to the outsider to be seamless transitions from one world to another.

Telecommunications Strategy","Philip M. Parker is a Professor of Marketing at INSEAD and the INSEAD Chaired Professor of Management Science. Before joining INSEAD, he was a Professor of International Strategy and Economics at the University of California, San Diego. He has taught at Harvard University, MIT, Stanford University, and UCLA, and delivered courses in various countries in Africa, the Middle East, Asia, Latin America, North America, and Europe. He has degrees in Finance and Economics, and a PhD from the Wharton School of the University of Pennsylvania.

Philip M. Parker is the programme director of the Business Strategy for HR Leaders Executive Education programme.

He is an economist and his research explores why existing theories governing macroeconomic growth and firm level competition yield unreliable forecasts of actual market outcomes. He introduced the idea that physical sciences (physics and physiology) should be directly integrated into macroeconomics. His contrarian research concludes that certain economic development measures, such as income per capita, can dramatically exaggerate the levels of poverty in a country, but also be poor indicators of future economic growth. Some of his work was published in his book Marketing Management: A Strategic Decision-Making Approach and Physioeconomics: The Basis for Long-Run Economic Growth (MIT Press, 2000) in which he forecasts global economic and demographic trends to the year 2100. He argues that critical economic axioms violate laws of physics and shows that convergence across nations is unlikely, if not impossible, in the long run. Free markets will, however, allow countries to converge to similar levels of well-being across individuals, but at dramatically different levels of income-based consumption (i.e. low-income countries may remain so, but will not be “poorer” than high-income countries) provided that citizens are given economic liberty. Wealth redistribution, from “richer” countries to “poorer” countries, in these cases, is not justified for the sake of “poverty reduction”, and may actually increase poverty.

He has also studied how firms generate market inefficiencies by relying on common forms of information asymmetry (creating markets for “sweet lemons” where low-quality products drive higher-quality products from the market, at higher prices). His work also debunks the notion that allowing more competitors in regulated markets (e.g. telecommunications) will lead to competition if remaining firms are allowed to cross-own or vertically integrate. His work has appeared in the leading journals including Rand Journal of Economics and the International Journal of Industrial Organization.

In March 1998, after directing a workshop for the World Bank which considered illiteracy, he launched a private initiative dubbed the “K to 12 +2 project”. One aspect of this problem is the lack of educational materials in local languages (the smaller the language in population, the less likely the publishing industry will find it profitable to serve such communities, leaving some 1000 written languages without basic textbooks). Utilising the automated authoring processes which he pioneered, his international business publications have funded a variety of multilingual educational materials including a free online multilingual dictionary, PC games, videos, and ebooks. He applied this approach to support projects sponsored by the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation creating thousands of factsheets (using meta-analysis) on tropical plants, and currently works on automated rural radio scripts, call center materials serving smallholder farmers, and SMS content engines collaborating with the GSM Association, the Grameen Foundation, and Farm Radio International in Kenya, Uganda, Malawi, and India, among other developing countries. As a hobby, he applied the graph theory to automatically author hundreds of thousands of didactic poems (limericks, sonnets, haiku, acrostics, etc.) and is working on fiction and academic studies."

Winnie is currently working on several research projects investigating how work meanings are influenced by and influence individual mobility, well-being, organizational effectiveness, and social changes. She asks questions such as how do individuals find, pursue, and sustain meaning in their work in complex and rapidly changing social systems; how does individuals’ quest for meaning in work influence the organizations and institutions to which they belong; and how could organizations cultivate meaningful work experiences and career growth for the benefit of individuals, organizations, and society. To answer these questions, she has been conducting longitudinal studies using both qualitative and quantitative methodologies based on a variety of social issues and settings, such as massive shrinkage of journalism, burnout epidemic in healthcare, and resource constraint in refugee resettlement. 

Relatedly, Winnie is interested in human resource management, examining factors that help unleash employees’ fullest potential and actualize their purpose at work. She recently contributed a book chapter on how human capital, social capital, and individual identity influence the portability of employee job performance to The Oxford Handbook of Talent Management.

Originally from Guangdong, China, Winnie received higher education in the US. Prior to joining INSEAD, she completed her PhD in Management at Yale University. Her dissertation examined how individuals pursue, sustain, and leave deeply meaningful work – or, as many of her research participants would say, a calling. She received her BA summa cum laude from Agnes Scott College where she majored in Psychology, Economics and Organizational Management and minored in Mathematics. While studying in the US, she also gained work experience in both the non-profit (Chicago Mayor’s Office of Special Events) and for-profit (OrgSolutions group at McKinsey & Company) sectors.

Throughout his career, Professor Doz has endeavoured to act as a valuable bridge between management practice and academic research. He began his working life in a corporate context, working on international helicopter development programs, before moving into academia, first at HEC, then Harvard Business School, and finally joining the faculty of INSEAD in 1980. As a public acknowledgement of his bridging role, Professor Doz was the first recipient of the CK Prahalad Distinguished Scholar-Practitioner Award, by the Strategic Management Society in 2011.

The “red-thread” in his research, teaching and consulting work over the decades, is a concern with helping companies reach good strategic decisions when facing contradictory demands: For example, local vs. global pressures in multinational firms, collaboration vs competition between alliance partners, dispersed knowledge search vs co-location in fostering innovation, and strategic commitment vs. agility in fast-changing industries. 

Professor Doz has been at the forefront of conceptualizing and proposing a number of widely adopted management practices over the years, from his early work on reconciling global integration and local responsiveness in multinational companies with CK Prahalad to his conceptualisation of the enablers of Strategic Agility (his research findings on this are summarized in the book Fast Strategy, published in 2008 by Wharton Business Press and co-authored with Mikko Kosonen).

Professor Doz has authored several other books, most recently: Ringtone: Exploring the Rise and Fall of Nokia in Mobile Phones, which won the much coveted George S. Terry Award from the Academy of Management “for best book on management” in 2018 (published by Oxford University Press and co-authored with Keeley Wilson). He is also the author of numerous articles, both academic and managerial.

He has acted as an advisor to the top management of many companies, been a keynote speaker at countless conferences and corporate events and, has taught programmes at business schools around the world including Stanford GSB, Seoul National University and both Aoyama and Keio in Japan at. At INSEAD he created and for many years directed a senior executive seminar on strategic alliances and has taught numerous company-specific programs.

Professor Doz is currently working on research into making corporate governance more strategic; further work on agility; and on building and governing multi-party alliances and ecosystems.

Social Identities and Diversity (EDP, EMCCC),
The Thesis (EMCCC)","Zoe Kinias is an Associate Professor of Organisational Behaviour at INSEAD and the Academic Director of INSEAD’s Gender Initiative. She is also a member of the INSEAD Randomized Control Trials Lab.

After ten years teaching MBAs, first at the Kellogg School of Management and then at INSEAD, Zoe now teaches primarily in executive programmes. Her teaching topics focus on leadership development, social issues at the intersection of business and society, and psychological research in applied/business contexts. She has taught the core Organisational Behaviour PhD course at INSEAD since 2011. Zoe Kinias is directing the INSEAD Gender Diversity Programme.

Zoe has two broad research goals: to understand how individuals, particularly those who are chronically or contextually vulnerable, can become more resilient, and to understand the consequences of diversity for emotions, cognitions, and performance. Her resiliency research stream investigates the factors that facilitate effective decision-making, performance, and wellbeing. This work focuses on interventions that attenuate biases, reduce negative emotion, and improve individual and group outcomes. Her diversity research stream seeks to understand how social identities—in particular gender, ethnicity, and cultural background—influence people’s cognitive processes, emotional states, and evaluations. 

In the past few years Zoe has increasingly focused on the overlap between these two research streams, examining global women’s experiences of identity threat and how these can be mitigated by cost-effective and powerful interventions. She uses experimental and quasi-experimental (gender, ethnicity, and national culture cannot be randomly assigned) methods in the laboratory and field to increase internal validity and draw strong causal inferences, as well as archival, survey, and qualitative methods to strengthen ecological validity. One paper from this diversity and resiliency stream was awarded the Academy of Management’s Faculty Transnational Research Award (2015). 

Zoe’s work has been published in leading management and psychology journals, including the Journal of Applied Psychology, Organizational Behavior and Human Decision Processes, and Psychological Science.
